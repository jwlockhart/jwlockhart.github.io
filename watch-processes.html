    <p>Every computer has at least one program for monitoring resource use, and they're increadibly helpful for doing CSS work. I keep one open any time I'm working, and I think you should, too. </p>
<p>These tools go by namy names: "system monitor," "activity monitor," "resource monitor," "top," "htop"... All of these tools do the same thing: they show you what processes are running on a computer, along with how much CPU (processor) and RAM (memory) they are using (among other things). They're super useful for catching and understanding problems with our code. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you ran some code but don't have results yet, you can see if your code is using CPU (thinking/processing/crunching numbers). <ul>
<li>If it is using 100% of a processor, then it just needs more time to do its calculations.</li>
<li>If it is using less than 100% of a CPU, it is probably "bottlenecked" or limited by something else. Processors are the fastest parts of a computer, so they often have to wait on slower parts like your hard drive or internet connection to get the data they will process. Seeing resource use helps you know <em>why</em> code is sometimes slow. </li>
<li>If it is not using any CPU, then something is probably wrong. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you wrote code that you wanted to run in parallel, you can easily see whether it is actually running in parallel by seeing if it is using multiple CPUs.</li>
<li>If you get memory-related errors, watching the system monitor can tell you if your code is using up a lot of memory, or if some other program is hogging the memory you need. </li>
<li>Even when you don't get memory errors, seeing how much memory your code uses can give you a sense of whether it is possible to handle more data or run the same code on smaller computers. </li>
<li>It can also warn you before memory errors happen: if you see memory usage creeping up to your system's maximum, you can take action so that you do not run out of memory.</li>
<li>Many system monitors also show network use, which can be very helpful to know when web scraping or using APIs. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is all well and good, but what if I'm in the terminal?</strong> This happens often, especially when we log into remote servers to do our work. Never fear: in the terminal, you can use the command <code>top</code> to see the same information, in all of its black-and-white-text glory. <code>top</code> is a bit ugly, though, so I prefer <code>htop</code>. It has more information, usage bars, and color-coding, so if you have it or can install it, it's definitely a better tool.</p>
<p>So next time you're working with CSS tools, open up a system monitor before you start and glance at it occasionally as you work. You might just catch a problem before it happens!</p>

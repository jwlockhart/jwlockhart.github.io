Summary: A hello world post


Hello, World! I'm starting a blog. It will focus mostly on the practical aspects of doing computational social science (CSS).[ref]If you're feeling cheeky you could call this "data science" or "big data."[/ref] While most CSS tools are well documented[ref]Okay, I have lots of feelings about tools that should have better documentation (ahem, R and Spark), but I won't be doing much of that here.[/ref], many of the data sets and general problems we face in CSS are not. Often, those of us doing CSS get practical advice from blogs and sites like Stack Overflow. So, to be less of a leech, I'll be blogging about data sets, problems, and approaches as they come up in my own research and teaching. 

### My background
I'm a sociologist these days, working on my PhD at the University of Michigan. Before this, I completed a BS and MS in computer science, during which time I spent 5 years working in the Wireless Sensor Data Mining Lab at Fordham, studying human biometrics using the sensors embedded in cell phones. I also completed a BS and MPhil in women's and gender studies. Straddling these disciplines has been a trip. More than anything, it motivates me to bridge the gap between technical expertise and subject expertise. There is so much social scientists can do with computational tools, but there aren't great avenues learn. One shouldn't *need* multiple degrees in computer science to work in CSS. Worse still, workshops and bootcamps for programming and other computational tools are rarely designed for a social science audience. I have been fortunate to participate in some excellent exceptions to this rule: Data Science for Social Good and the Summer Institute for Computational Social Science. I also teach and organize the University of Michigan's Summer Data Camp, and I'm on the team designing our university's first computational social science course. This blog is an attempt to make computer science insights and practical applications more accessible to social scientists. 

### Disclaimers
- Computer science is full of people with strong, mostly arbitrary preferences. I like VIM and python, I find emacs and R stylistically irksome.[ref]Can you keep a secret? My favorite language is still perl.[/ref] Use the tools you like. The big ideas generally are not tool-specific.
- The examples and solutions I post are not going to be perfectly optimized. Good-enough is the name of the game in CSS. (I will write about how to measure "good enough," though.)
- In general, I won't maintain old posts. If a new version of a package breaks some code, then it's probably going to stay broken. 

Cheers, Y'all.

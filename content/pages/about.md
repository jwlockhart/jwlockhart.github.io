Summary: About Jeff Lockhart


I'm a PhD Candidate in sociology at the University of Michigan. My research interests lie primarily at the intersections of: sociology of knowledge; comparative research methods (qualitative, statistical, and computational/data science); and gender and sexuality. My research has been published and presented in a number of venues, including university journals and international conferences. Some of my work and writing also appears in public media.

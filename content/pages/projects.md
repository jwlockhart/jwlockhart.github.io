Summary: Jeff Lockhart's current projects


My dissertation work explores the dynamics of debates among biologists about the nature of human sex and gender. Specifically, I explore how various positions gain and lose influence in the scientific community over time and the roles that social dynamics, data, and ideology play in that change. Data sources for my dissertation include the Web of Science, JStor, scientific publications, author CVs, and interviews with scientists.

My MPhil dissertation research is an interview- and archive-based study of the logic and public discourse of the United Kingdom's right-wing LGBT+ organizations. These organizations have extensive political access compared to their counterparts in other Western democracies. I examine how their various class positions, levels of institutional support, histories, and ideological environments shape a variety of sometimes unexpected gay conservativisms. This project currently has a paper under review.

I work with Elizabeth Bruch to identify and understand the strategies and approaches people use in online dating. This project utilizes digital trace data provided by a large, free, online dating company.

I am involved with numerous smaller projects that fit under the umbrella of Computational Social Science. Some are research-focused, like a collaborative project to evaluate the accuracy and bias of labels returned by Google's Vision API. Others center on curriculum or infrastructure development for computational social science.
